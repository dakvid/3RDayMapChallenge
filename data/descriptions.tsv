hrbrmstr_2019_01	usa,small multiples,points,security	The topic for Day 1 was “points” and I opted to use a Google spreadsheet of (mostly) geolocated U.S. K-12 school ransomware incidents going back to 2016 as a base for plotting locations of these events on a map. This checked the “cyber” and “United States” requirements boxes in my list of constraints and also helped ease into the challenge (it doesn’t get much more basic than points on a map, though we are mixing it up a bit with facets).
hrbrmstr_2019_02	maine,usa,world,lines,trade,exports	The U.S. Census provides data on top exports from U.S. states. I came across the data they have on Maine and thought it’d be fun to use lines to show movement of goods outside of Maine.
hrbrmstr_2019_03	maine,usa,heatmap,internet	Most maps use polygons to draw features (i.e. each state on a U.S. map is most likely a polygon if the map isn’t a raster image) so today’s challenge could simply have been to just “draw a map”. I decided to do a bit more work than that and thought that making a polygon-based heatmap (a.k.a. filled 2D kernel density polygons) would make for an interesting entry. Comcast — a U.S. internet provider — has a “hotspot locator” app that customers can use to, well, locate Wi-Fi hotspots when they’re out and about. Just zoom around or enter a zip code to see a listing of all the hotspots in a given area.
hrbrmstr_2019_04	world,shipping,crime,hex,grid,headmap	I started maintaining a package (asam) that lets folks work with “anti-shipping activity messages” maintained by the U.S. National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency when I began crafting my annual R-themed “Talk Like a Pirate Day” posts. Each record in the ASAM database contains high level information on each incident, including longitude/latitude along with ship and offender metadata and a brief blurb on the incident. Most of these incidents are pirates and they’ve kept a log since 1978 of all these incidents. I thought a hex grid heatmap of all ASAM incidents since the database inception would be a fun way to meet today’s challenge.
hrbrmstr_2019_05	usa,climate,heatmap,animation	The U.S. National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center maintains many datasets and I thought it’d be neat to make an animation of the daily minimum temperatures across the conterminus U.S. for 2019.
hrbrmstr_2019_06	world,blue,choropleth	The World Happiness Report is an annual survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. Since the opposite of “happy” is “sad” and another word for “sad” is “blue” I decided to chart just how miserable folks around the globe perceive themselves to be.
hrbrmstr_2019_08	usa,maine,green,roads,names,interactive	The U.S. Census Bureau maintains many databases of geographic information free for use by anyone. The data is referenced as “Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing” — i.e. “TIGER” — and they describe land attributes such as roads, buildings, rivers, and lakes, along with census tracts. I thought it’d be fun to map all the roads in Maine with “green” in the name.
hrbrmstr_2019_09	world,animation,light,yellow	The line on the surface of our planet that separates day and night is called the “terminator” and for today’s challenge I decided to create an animation of this line as it moves across the Earth. To do this, we need to compute the terminator for each hour.
hrbrmstr_2019_10	usa,maine,roads,black and white,lines	Since we’re already familiar with TIGER / {tigris} let’s use the entire roads data set for Maine to paint a picture of Maine without borders (i.e. let the roads make the map to see just how much of Maine we can recognize just with the primary road system).
hrbrmstr_2019_11	usa,maine,island,elevation	We love Acadia National Park and I used today’s challenge to finally chart out all of Mount Desert Island (MDI). There are links in the code-blocks to the various data sources where I obtained basemaps and elevation data. Where possible, these elements have been carved up and minified to make it easier to work with them.
hrbrmstr_2019_12	usa,maine,small multiples,travel,lines	The U.S. Census’ American Community Survey (ACS) asks respondents about their primary workplace location. When information about workers’ residence location and workplace location are coupled, a commuting flow is generated. The origin-destination flow format informs our understanding of interconnectedness between communities, including the interchange of people, goods, and services. They make this data available online and I decided to take a look at all the places Mainers go (outside of Maine) to work.
hrbrmstr_2019_13	usa,borders,politics	Many organizations maintain up-to-date shapefiles of the latest U.S. Congressional voting districes. The GeoJSON used here comes from the Civil Services Accountability in Action GitHub. These virtual district borders are human-made creations that are supposed to help the democratic process be more fair. Alas, both major parties in the U.S. hack these shapes to suit themselves whenever power flips in Washington. Since most folks outside of ultra-political circles almost never see these district shapes, I thought both a complete view and separate view of the 116th Congress borders would be interesting to show.
hrbrmstr_2019_14	usa,rail,historical,animation	I took “tracks” quite literally for today’s challenge and grabbed a shapefile that documents the creation and expansion of the conterminus U.S. railroad system. We’ll grab the data and generate animation frames as we’ve done in previous challenges.
hrbrmstr_2019_15	usa,maine,names,word cloud	The U.S. Social Security Administration maintains historical, popular baby names by state database that they’ve put online. Where there may be a data file for this out there somewhere I just threw together a quick scraper for it vs spend time googling.
hrbrmstr_2019_16	usa,points,economy	I track a few different happenings in the world, one of which is the “retail apocalypse”. I’ve been collecting this data for a bit, but we’ll use some scraping techniques to pull lists from Business Insider, too. My first thought for “places” was “places impacted by something” and losing these resources and jobs is pretty tough on a region despite the “great” economy we’re supposed to be in.
hrbrmstr_2019_17	world,choropleth,crime,shipping	I pondered a bit on what to do for today’s challenge since there are many types of zones: environmental… temperate… time… After checking out some of my older blog posts, I went back over to my {asam} package (we used this in a previous challenge) which has a shapefile I made from the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA)/National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) Catalog of Hydrographic Products. There are 9 ASAM global regions and 52 ASAM global subregions. These are referenced in REGION and SUBREGION fields in the returned {sf} object. I’m classifying these as zones for the sake of this challenge. What is an NIMA/ASAM region/subregion? Well, for their use, the world is divided into nine regions: each corresponding to the geographic limits of one of the nine regions in the NIMA catalog. Each region is further divided into numbered subregions. The first digit of all five-digit chart numbers indicates the geographic region while the first two digits of all five-digit chart numbers refer to the geographic subregion. That may be super dry commentary, but at least they’ve got a data strategy.
hrbrmstr_2019_18	world,globe,internet,crime,interactive	The $DAYJOB (as of the production date of this tome) provides lots of fun data to work with. Sadly, most of it doesn’t belong in a world-geography context. However, IP addresses do have some notion of geolocation information associated with them. I decided to abuse my data for today’s challenge and use the {threejs} package — which wraps the three.js javascript library — to plot honeypot attack data on a 3D globe (i.e. a 3D “pew pew” map).
hrbrmstr_2019_19	usa,new england,light,raster	We live in rural Maine for many reasons, one of which is to have the privilege of being able to see more of the night sky than most city folk are able to view. This light pollution is tracked by NASA’s Black Marble project. I decided to compare known New England urban areas to the Black Marble data to both show that these areas do contribute to this light pollution and to see just where these centers of light pollution are located.
hrbrmstr_2019_20_1	usa,counties,choropleth,agriculture,green	The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) performs an annual agriculture census and makes the data available for use by anyone who can decipher their yearly-changing code book.

hrbrmstr_2019_21	usa,main,counties,climate change,sea level rise,zoom	Global warming is “a thing” and sea-level rise has been a phenomenon that many coastal communities have had to deal with for quite some time now. I wanted to see how sea-level rise would impact my environment. Thankfully, NASA makes that easy with their Sea Level Rise Datasets which are predictions based off on historical observations sound science.

lxndrkp_2020_01	germany,friedrichshain-kreuzberg,cars,roads,points,interactive	There are 80,808 cars registered in Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg (2017). If all cars would start driving at the same time - it’d get pretty crowded 🚗🚗 🚗
lxndrkp_2020_02	germany,flights,lines,interactive	About 10% of all flights from German airports are domestic flights - so starting in Germany and landing in Germany.
lxndrkp_2020_03	germany,berlin,voronoi,interactive	The catchment area of boulder gyms in Berlin. Playing around with Voroni maps: “Voronoi polygons are created so that every location within a polygon is closer to the sample point in that polygon than any other sample point.” Here: All boulder gyms (that I know of) in Berlin. If everyone would go his or her closest gym (by beeline), this would be the catchment areas of each boulder gym.
lxndrkp_2020_04	germany,stuttgart,traffic,3d,interactive,grid,hexagon	Traffic accidents in Stuttgart. The ‘Statistikportal’ offers a great data set on (almost) all accidents in Germany as single points. The mapdeck package auto aggregates point data into hexagons - so no need for data pre-processing. I chose to crop the data to the outline of Stuttgart - but any other region or city can easily be used with the code by setting a different outline.
lxndrkp_2020_06	world,points,interactive	Rotpunkt. Today is another one on climbing - it’s less about the mapping tools. In sport climbing, redpointing is free-climbing a route, while lead climbing, after having practiced the route beforehand. The English term “redpoint” is a loan translation of the German Rotpunkt coined by Kurt Albert in the mid-1970s at Frankenjura. He would paint a red X on a fixed pin so that he could avoid using it for a foot- or handhold. Once he was able to free-climb the entire route, he would put a red dot at the base of the route. In many ways, this was the origin of the free climbing movement that led to the development of sport climbing ten years later. This map shows all notable ascents according to Wikipedia.
lxndrkp_2020_08	germany,yellow,light,heatmap,interactive	Hours of sunshine in Germany 2019. Where in Germany was a lot of sunshine in 2019 - where was it rather grey?
lxndrkp_2020_09	germany,berlin,roads,lines,interactive	The life lines of Berlin. A fast way to find major streets within a city, without searching for any data on traffic amounts, street types or street width: Take random start and end points within the city and run a routing to find routes connecting the start and end points. Then aggregate the single street segments on how often they were used. You then get an image of the major city axes. Big thanks to the stplanr package, which makes this easily done within a few lines of code!
lxndrkp_2020_10	germany,berlin,grid,interactive	Which cuisine can you eat where in Berlin?
lxndrkp_2020_11	europe,3d,elevation	Mapping the Alps in 3D. Playing around with the mapdeck::add_terrain() function. Not perfect yet, but works for a first try.
lxndrkp_2020_13	germany,berlin,raster,interactive	Noise level in Berlin. OpenGIS Web Services (OWS) define geospatial standards to provide geo data, like WFS (Web Feature Service) for vector data and WMS (Web Map Service) for raster data. Yet, these standards are not widely known with developers or data analysts who are used to working with ESRI-shape files, geojsons, etc. Some spatial data infrastructure providers, as the Geodatenportal Berlin (FIS-Broker) only offer these services and no further file download. There are some resources on how to use those services in R, e.g. here some general info and here more specific for the Berlin FIS-Broker. Though, all example code was on retrieving vector data of WFS services. For todays challenge “raster” I wanted to try out, how easy it is to get raster data (WMS) straight into R. It’s not entirely straight forward, as you need to find some parameters (e.g. “layers”) through the getCapabilities query first. Then you retrieve a PNG where you need to set a proper georeference again, with a bounding box and CRS. Therefore, I still find the easiest way for a one time download to use QGIS (I wrote a blog post on how to do that at the Technologiestiftung Berlin), as QGIS does all this setting the correct parameters already for you.
lxndrkp_2020_14	germany,interactive	In 2019 121.500 square km of rain forest had been destroyed. But how much is that? This map shows a polygon as large as the destroyed area that can be moved to any spot on the map to compare it to.
lxndrkp_2020_20	germany,berlin,population,interactive	Movement within Berlin (“Binnenwanderung”). Many people are moving to Berlin from other places - especially the center - “im Ring” - is popular for people comiing to the city. But once in Berlin - how do people move between the different districts (“Binnenwanderung”)? More people move from the center districts to the outskirts (Data from 2013). Click on a district to see where the people are coming from that move to this district. Click events on leaflet maps are possible with shiny observe events.
lxndrkp_2020_22	germany,berlin,transport,trains,animation,interactive	U-Bahn trains moving through Berlin. All U-Bahn trains moving through the city on a regular Monday using the {mapdeck::add_trips()} function.
lxndrkp_2020_30	world,interactive	Create your own basemap with Mapbox Studio. Ever wanted pink rivers or lilac streets on your basemap? That can easily be done with Mapbox Studio.

NRatnaweera_2021_02	switzerland,lines	I visualize the effect of the transition from Switzerland's old coordinate system to the new one. Its a crazy, stormy pattern!
richard_vogg_2021_01	chile,earthquakes,points	I decided to continue where I stopped last year and worked on the map showing earthquakes in Chile in the last 21 years.
richard_vogg_2021_02	germany,transport,rail,lines	Today I worked on a map showing the rail network in Germany.
richard_vogg_2021_03	europe,simplification	I looked at the Geocomputation with R book (#TidyTuesday). I found it interesting to see that there are several algorithms to simplify polygons. When Italy loses the shoe shape, I feel it is time to stop.
