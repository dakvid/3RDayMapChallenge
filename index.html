      A gallery of maps made with
      <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a>
      with reproducible (hopefully!) code.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2019 Topi Tjukanov
      <a href="https://twitter.com/tjukanov/status/1187713840550744066">announced</a>
      the #30DayMapChallenge on Twitter out of the blue, and there was so much enthusiasm that it has
      become an annual event - see
      <a href="https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge">https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      The event is a fun and friendly opportunity for cartographical practice, to try new things without the
      pressure of perfection, and to be inspired by what other people have created.
      And what's better than a cool map to inspire you to try something similar?
      A cool map with code so you can immediately reproduce and adapt it!
    </p>
    <h3>Where are the maps?</h3>
    <p>
      <span class="text-info">
        Click through to the
        <a href="maps.html">map gallery</a>
        where you can explore some maps.
      </span>
      Filter by year, challenge theme, or R packages used, and search by
      manually added tags (eg 'interactive', 'africa', 'sport') or user handle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then click on a map to see a larger version, and links to the code,
      tweet and web page (if one exists).
    </p>
    <h3>Updates</h3>
    <p>
      I aim to include all relevant maps from 2019 onwards, but it's time consuming so I
      make no guarantees of speed. If I've got some maps from a person then you can
      assume I'll pick up later maps they release. If you think I've missed some maps
              and they're not on my
      <a href="todo.txt">todo list</a>
      then drop me a line on
      <a href="https://twitter.com/dakvid">Twitter</a>
      or email (change a dot to an @ in the domain).
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that I have only been following the hashtag on Twitter (and my
      previous galleries have been Twitter-only) but I'm happy to include
      maps posted anywhere - Instragram, LinkedIn, Github, ...
    </p>
    <h3>Colophon</h3>
    <p>
      This site is made with
      <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 4</a>
      and the
      <a href="https://bootswatch.com/lux/">Lux</a>
      theme from Bootswatch.
      The gallery was made with
      <a href="https://vestride.github.io/Shuffle/">shuffle.js</a>
      and
      <a href="https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes">lazysizes.</a>
      The data munging and HTML construction is performed by some rough
      <a href="https://github.com/dakvid/3RDayMapChallenge">R code.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      I quickly cobbled together a gallery of all the maps in 2019 just after
      the challenge ended - it wasn't sophisticated but it worked.
      In 2020 I was able to reuse the gallery code, but it was even more
      time-consuming to process the tweets, and the page was only just
      working with the amount of maps people produced (a sign of success!).
      I decided early on that I wouldn't redo this in 2021 as I wouldn't
      have time either to process the tweets or write a new more
      technically viable gallery. But the thought occurred to try a
      gallery of just R maps with code - I could reuse the gallery code
      and create a useful resource.
